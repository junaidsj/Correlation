# Correlation Analysis with Python 🧠📊

This project demonstrates how to calculate and visualize correlation between different features of a dataset using Python. It focuses on understanding the linear relationships between numerical variables through correlation matrices and heatmaps.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` and should be a CSV file with multiple numerical features. Make sure your dataset is properly cleaned and formatted before correlation analysis.

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

- **Correlation Matrix**: Understanding how variables are linearly related using `.corr()`.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Using `seaborn.heatmap()` to identify high/low correlations visually.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Basic inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.isnull()`.
